# Challenge Insight

A page that interacts with the Proof of Humanity GraphQL API, and displays the most used words in every challenge justification. You can filter by word, by date and compare an earlier and later segment of time, and have ease of access to the challenged profile and the case at Kleros. Its also possible to see every challenge description till the current date, hovering with the mouse pointer provides the full text.
